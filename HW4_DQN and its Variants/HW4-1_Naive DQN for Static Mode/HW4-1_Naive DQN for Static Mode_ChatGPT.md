# HW4-1_Naive DQN for Static Mode
## Prompt:
Explain Naive DQN (Deep Q-Network).

## Response:
**Naive Deep Q-Network (Naive DQN)** is an early and simplified form of using deep learning for reinforcement learning, particularly for approximating Q-values in **Q-learning** using neural networks.

Let‚Äôs break it down:

* * *

### **1\. Background: Q-Learning**

Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that seeks to learn the **Q-function**, which estimates the expected future rewards of taking an action  $a$  in a given state  $s$  and following the optimal policy thereafter:

$$
Q(s, a) = \text{expected return from } s \text{ taking } a
$$

The update rule is:

$$
Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \left[ r_t + \gamma \max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a) - Q(s_t, a_t) \right]
$$

* * *

### **2\. Problem: Q-Table Doesn‚Äôt Scale**

In large or continuous state spaces (like images or high-dimensional sensors), it's impractical to use a table to store Q-values for every state-action pair.

* * *

### **3\. Solution: Deep Q-Network (DQN)**

Instead of a table, a **neural network**  $Q(s, a; \theta)$  is used to approximate Q-values. This is called a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**.

In **Naive DQN**, this is done in the simplest possible way, usually **without the stabilizing tricks** used in more advanced versions.

* * *

### **4\. Naive DQN Structure**

*   Input: Current state  $s$ 
    
*   Output: Q-values for all possible actions
    
*   Loss function: Based on the temporal difference (TD) error:
    

$$
L(\theta) = \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta) - Q(s, a; \theta) \right)^2
$$

* * *

### **5\. Limitations of Naive DQN**

Naive DQN can learn, but it suffers from **instability and divergence** due to:

*   **Correlated updates** (samples from consecutive time steps are similar)
    
*   **Moving targets** (the Q-network is both selecting and evaluating the action)
    
*   **Overestimation bias** (always taking max Q-values)
    

* * *

### **6\. Improvements Over Naive DQN**

The full DQN introduced by DeepMind in 2015 includes several improvements:

*   **Experience Replay**: Store past transitions in a buffer and sample randomly to break correlations.
    
*   **Target Network**: Maintain a separate network  $Q_{\text{target}}$  for computing the target Q-value, which is updated less frequently.
    
*   **Clipping rewards or normalizing inputs**
    

* * *

### **Summary**

| Aspect | Naive DQN |
| --- | --- |
| Q-function | Approximated with a neural network |
| Stability tricks | None (no replay, no target network) |
| Uses | Good for small problems; educational |
| Problems | Unstable learning, diverging Q-values |

Here's a breakdown of the **first part** of your uploaded notebook titled **"HW4-1\_Naive DQN.ipynb"**:

* * *

### üîπ **Code Cell 1: Data Visualization**

This cell is not related to DQN. It‚Äôs a basic example of using matplotlib and numpy:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

data = np.random.randn(100)  # Generate 100 random numbers
mean_value = np.mean(data)   # Compute mean

# Plot the data
plt.scatter(range(len(data)), data, alpha=0.5)
plt.axhline(mean_value, color='red', linestyle='--', label='Mean')
plt.xlabel('Data Points')
plt.ylabel('Values')
plt.title('Scatter Plot with Mean Value')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

üü° **Purpose**: Probably just a demo of plotting. Not part of the DQN logic.

* * *

### üîπ **Code Cell 2: Environment Setup**

```python
from Gridworld import Gridworld
game = Gridworld(size=4, mode='static')
```

üü¢ **Explanation**:

*   Loads a **custom Gridworld environment**, likely a small grid used for testing reinforcement learning agents.
    
*   `size=4`: 4x4 grid.
    
*   `mode='static'`: Static configuration (probably fixed reward/goal layout).
    

* * *

### üîπ **Code Cell 3 & 4: Manual Game Interaction**

```python
game.display()            # Shows the current grid state
game.makeMove('d')        # Moves the agent (likely 'd' = right)
```

üü¢ **Purpose**:

*   Allows you to visually test the environment manually before applying the DQN.

### üîπ **Code Cells 5‚Äì8: More Environment Exploration**

```python
game.display()
game.reward()
game.board.render_np()
game.board.render_np().shape
```

üü¢ **Purpose**:

*   Explore how the environment looks and what kind of state representation it provides.
    
*   `render_np()` likely returns a **flat NumPy array** used as input to the neural network.
    

* * *

### üîπ **Code Cell 9: Model Definition and Initialization**

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
from Gridworld import Gridworld
from IPython.display import clear_output
import random
from matplotlib import pylab as plt

# Neural Network architecture
L1 = 64    # Input layer (flattened state)
L2 = 150   # First hidden layer
L3 = 100   # Second hidden layer
L4 = 4     # Output layer (Q-values for 4 actions)

model = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.Linear(L1, L2),
    torch.nn.ReLU(),
    torch.nn.Linear(L2, L3),
    torch.nn.ReLU(),
    torch.nn.Linear(L3, L4)
)

# Loss and optimizer
loss_fn = torch.nn.MSELoss()
learning_rate = 1e-3
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# RL hyperparameters
gamma = 0.9      # Discount factor
epsilon = 1.0    # Initial exploration rate
```

üîç **Explanation**:

*   A simple **feedforward neural network** is used to approximate the Q-values.
    
*   The input size is 64, suggesting the environment provides an 8√ó8 state flattened to 64 features.
    
*   The output is 4 values ‚Äì presumably for the 4 actions: up, down, left, right.
    
*   This is a classic **Naive DQN** setup: one model, no target network, no experience replay.

Here's the key part of your Naive DQN implementation ‚Äî the **training loop** ‚Äî along with an explanation of how your agent learns:

* * *

### üîπ **Code Cell 10: Action Mapping**

```python
action_set = {
    0: 'u',  # up
    1: 'd',  # down
    2: 'l',  # left
    3: 'r'   # right
}
```

üîπ **Maps action indices (0‚Äì3)** to their corresponding movement directions in the Gridworld.

* * *

### üîπ **Code Cell 11: Training Loop**

This is the core logic of **Naive DQN training**:

#### üß† **Overview**:

*   Trains for 1000 episodes (epochs)
    
*   Uses an Œµ-greedy strategy (Œµ decays over time)
    
*   No experience replay or target network
    

#### üß© **Key Elements**:

```python
epochs = 1000
losses = []

for i in range(epochs):
    game = Gridworld(size=4, mode='static')
    state_ = game.board.render_np().reshape(1,64) + np.random.rand(1,64)/10.0
    state1 = torch.from_numpy(state_).float()
    status = 1
    while(status == 1):
        qval = model(state1)
        qval_ = qval.data.numpy()

        # Epsilon-greedy action selection
        if (random.random() < epsilon): 
            action_ = np.random.randint(0, 4)
        else:
            action_ = np.argmax(qval_)

        action = action_set[action_]
        game.makeMove(action)

        # Get next state
        state2_ = game.board.render_np().reshape(1,64) + np.random.rand(1,64)/10.0
        state2 = torch.from_numpy(state2_).float()
        reward = game.reward()

        # Estimate future rewards
        with torch.no_grad():
            newQ = model(state2)
        maxQ = torch.max(newQ)

        # Compute target Q-value
        Y = reward + (gamma * maxQ) if reward == -1 else reward
        Y = torch.Tensor([Y]).detach()

        # Current Q-value
        X = qval.squeeze()[action_]

        # Loss and backprop
        loss = loss_fn(X, Y)
        if i % 100 == 0:
            print(i, loss.item())
            clear_output(wait=True)

        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        state1 = state2
        if abs(reward) == 10:
            status = 0

    losses.append(loss.item())

    if epsilon > 0.1:
        epsilon -= (1/epochs)  # decay epsilon

# Plot training loss
plt.figure(figsize=(10,7))
plt.plot(losses)
plt.xlabel("Epochs")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
```

* * *

### ‚úÖ **What's Happening?**

| Part | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `qval = model(state1)` | Predict Q-values for current state |
| `action_ = argmax(qval)` | Choose best action (or random) |
| `Y = reward + Œ≥ * maxQ` | Compute the TD target |
| `loss = MSE(predicted, target)` | Train to reduce difference between predicted and target Q |
| `epsilon decay` | Decrease exploration over time |

* * *

### üîπ **Code Cells 12‚Äì14**

These are unrelated to DQN; they test basic PyTorch gradient mechanics using a simple linear model. Likely used for learning or checking how gradients work.

Would you like me to summarize the entire Naive DQN process in plain steps or help modify this to include improvements like Experience Replay or a Target Network?

## Prompt:
Summarize the entire Naive DQN process.

## Response:
Here‚Äôs a clear **summary of the entire Naive DQN process** from your notebook:

* * *

üß† Naive DQN: Summary
---------------------

### **1\. Environment Setup**

*   You use a custom **Gridworld environment** (`size=4`, `mode='static'`) to simulate a simple grid-based game.
    
*   The state is represented as a **flattened 64-dimensional vector** (4x4 grid with 4 channels).
    

* * *

### **2\. Neural Network Architecture**

*   A simple **feedforward neural network** approximates the Q-function  $Q(s, a)$ :
    
    *   Input: 64 features (flattened state)
        
    *   Hidden Layers: 150 and 100 neurons with ReLU
        
    *   Output: 4 values (Q-values for 4 actions: up, down, left, right)
        

* * *

### **3\. Training Loop**

For each of 1000 episodes:

#### **a. Initialization**

*   Reset the game.
    
*   Add noise to the state to improve generalization.
    
*   Set exploration rate `Œµ` high (starts at 1.0).
    

#### **b. Action Selection (Œµ-greedy)**

*   With probability Œµ: pick a random action (exploration)
    
*   Otherwise: pick the action with the **highest predicted Q-value** (exploitation)
    

#### **c. State Transition**

*   Execute the action in the environment.
    
*   Observe the new state and the reward.
    
*   Check if the episode is done.
    

#### **d. Q-Value Update (TD Learning)**

*   Predict Q-values for the new state.
    
*   Compute the **target Q-value**:
    
    $$
    Y = \text{reward} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a')
    $$
    
    unless it's a terminal state, in which case  $Y = \text{reward}$ .
    
*   Compute the loss (MSE) between predicted Q and target Q.
    
*   Backpropagate and update weights with **Adam optimizer**.
    

#### **e. Epsilon Decay**

*   Gradually decrease Œµ to reduce exploration over time (down to 0.1).
    

* * *

### **4\. Plot Training Loss**

*   The loss per episode is recorded and plotted to visualize learning progress.
    

* * *

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of Naive DQN
---------------------------

*   **No Experience Replay**: Each step is learned immediately, which leads to correlated updates.
    
*   **No Target Network**: The same model is used to select and evaluate actions, which can cause instability.
    
*   **Basic Œµ-decay**: Simple linear schedule, no adaptive or smart decay.
    

* * *

‚úÖ Educational Value
-------------------

Despite its limitations, Naive DQN captures the **core idea of using deep learning for reinforcement learning** and is great for:

*   Learning the RL pipeline
    
*   Testing environments
    
*   Extending into full DQN with stabilizing tricks
    

* * *

Would you like a visual diagram of the DQN architecture or help upgrading this to a more robust version (with replay buffer, target network, etc.)?

## Prompt:
Experience Replay Buffer

## Response:
### üß† **Experience Replay Buffer** ‚Äì Explained Simply

**Experience Replay** is a technique used in Deep Q-Learning to stabilize training and improve sample efficiency.

* * *

### üîÅ **Why Use It?**

In naive DQN:

*   You train on consecutive samples, which are **highly correlated**.
    
*   This makes learning unstable and inefficient.
    

With **experience replay**:

*   You **store past experiences** (state, action, reward, next\_state, done) in a buffer.
    
*   Then you **sample randomly** from this buffer to train the model.
    

This helps:

*   Break correlations between sequential samples.
    
*   Reuse experiences multiple times.
    
*   Reduce variance and improve convergence.
    

* * *

### üß± **Structure of the Buffer**

A basic experience replay buffer is just a **fixed-size queue (deque)** where each element is a transition:

```python
(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
```

* * *

### ‚úÖ **Minimal Implementation in Python**

```python
import random
from collections import deque

class ReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.buffer = deque(maxlen=capacity)  # Automatically discards old experiences

    def push(self, transition):
        self.buffer.append(transition)

    def sample(self, batch_size):
        return random.sample(self.buffer, batch_size)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.buffer)
```

* * *

### üß™ **How to Use It in DQN**

```python
# Initialize
buffer = ReplayBuffer(capacity=10000)

# Store a transition
buffer.push((state, action, reward, next_state, done))

# Sample a batch for training
if len(buffer) >= batch_size:
    batch = buffer.sample(batch_size)
    states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = zip(*batch)
```

* * *

Would you like an illustration of how this buffer interacts with training steps or how to combine it with prioritized replay?

## Prompt:
Explain buffer interacts with training steps and combine it with prioritized replay.

## Response:
Great ‚Äî let‚Äôs go step by step:

* * *

üîÅ **1\. How the Replay Buffer Interacts with Training Steps**
--------------------------------------------------------------

### üîπ Every Training Step Includes:

#### 1\. **Collecting Experience**

Each time the agent takes a step in the environment, you store a transition:

```python
transition = (state, action, reward, next_state, done)
buffer.push(transition)
```

#### 2\. **Sampling a Batch**

Once the buffer has enough data, you sample a **mini-batch** for training:

```python
batch = buffer.sample(batch_size)
```

#### 3\. **Training on Sampled Batch**

*   Extract tensors (states, actions, etc.)
    
*   Predict Q-values and compute target Q-values
    
*   Calculate loss (usually MSE)
    
*   Backpropagate and update model weights
    

* * *

### üì¶ **Diagram of the Flow**

```
 Environment Step
      ‚Üì
( state, action, reward, next_state, done )
      ‚Üì
   PUSH into Replay Buffer
      ‚Üì
 SAMPLE Mini-Batch from Buffer
      ‚Üì
 Train Model on Random Batch
```

This breaks temporal correlation and improves stability in training.

* * *

‚≠êÔ∏è **2\. Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)**
----------------------------------------------

### üß† **Motivation**

Not all experiences are equally useful. Prioritized Replay gives more attention to **‚Äúsurprising‚Äù** or **‚Äúimportant‚Äù** transitions (e.g., with higher TD error).

* * *

### üîπ Core Ideas of PER:

*   **Priority Score**: Each transition gets a priority (typically based on TD-error).
    
*   **Sampling Probability**: Transitions are sampled with probability proportional to their priority.
    
*   **Bias Correction**: Use **importance-sampling weights** to correct the bias this introduces.
    

* * *

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Simple PER Workflow**

```python
1. Calculate TD Error = |Q_pred - Q_target|
2. Set priority = TD error + small constant (e.g., 1e-5)
3. Sample batch using weighted probability based on priorities
4. Scale the loss using importance-sampling weights (to reduce bias)
```

* * *

### üõ†Ô∏è **Simplified PER Buffer (Conceptual Code)**

```python
class PrioritizedReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, capacity, alpha=0.6):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.buffer = []
        self.priorities = []
        self.alpha = alpha

    def push(self, transition, td_error):
        priority = (abs(td_error) + 1e-5) ** self.alpha
        if len(self.buffer) < self.capacity:
            self.buffer.append(transition)
            self.priorities.append(priority)
        else:
            # Replace oldest
            self.buffer.pop(0)
            self.priorities.pop(0)
            self.buffer.append(transition)
            self.priorities.append(priority)

### üß™ Training Integration with PER:

1.  After computing the TD error for each sampled transition:
    
    *   Use it to compute priority.
        
    *   Update the buffer with new priorities.
        
2.  When computing loss:
    
    *   Multiply it by the importance-sampling weights.

üìò Short Report: Experience Replay and Prioritized Experience Replay in DQN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üéØ Objective

To stabilize and improve the learning process in Deep Q-Networks (DQN) by reusing past experiences in a more efficient and targeted way.

* * *

### üîÅ Experience Replay

**Experience Replay** stores past agent interactions in a memory buffer:

*   Each interaction is a tuple:
    
    $$
    (state, action, reward, next\_state, done)
    $$
    
*   During training, random mini-batches are sampled from this buffer.
    

#### ‚úÖ Benefits:

*   Breaks temporal correlations between consecutive states.
    
*   Improves data efficiency by reusing old experiences.
    
*   Stabilizes learning by reducing variance in updates.
    

#### üîß Implementation (Basic):

*   A `deque` stores transitions.
    
*   When enough samples are collected, random batches are used to train the Q-network.
    

* * *

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)

**PER** improves upon uniform sampling by prioritizing experiences with **higher learning potential**.

#### üß† Key Idea:

*   Prioritize transitions with large **TD errors** (temporal difference between predicted and target Q-values).
    
*   These samples are likely to yield greater updates to the Q-network.
    

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanism:

*   Assign each transition a priority score:
    
    $$
    p_i = (|\text{TD-error}_i| + \varepsilon)^\alpha
    $$
    
*   Sample based on this score (not uniformly).
    
*   Use **importance-sampling weights** to correct for bias.
    

#### ‚úÖ Benefits:

*   Focuses learning on the most informative experiences.
    
*   Accelerates convergence and improves final performance.

### üìå Summary of Differences

| Feature | Experience Replay | Prioritized Replay |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sampling | Uniform | Based on TD-error priority |
| Data reuse | Random | Targeted (important samples) |
| Stability | Moderate | Higher |
| Implementation complexity | Simple | More involved |

* * *

### üß© Use Case in DQN Training

1.  **Interact with the environment** and collect transitions.
    
2.  **Store transitions** in the buffer (with priority in PER).
    
3.  **Sample a mini-batch** (uniformly or by priority).
    
4.  **Train the model** using predicted vs. target Q-values.
    
5.  **Update priorities** in PER after computing TD-errors.
    

* * *

### üß™ Conclusion

Experience Replay is crucial for effective deep reinforcement learning. While standard replay buffers offer stability, Prioritized Experience Replay enhances learning by focusing on high-impact transitions. Both techniques are widely used in modern RL algorithms.
