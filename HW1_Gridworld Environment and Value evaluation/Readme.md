# HW1: Gridworld Environment and Value evaluation

## HW1-1: Grid Map Development
**Goal:**
Develop an interactive n x n grid map where users can:
1. Specify grid dimension: Choose 'n' (range from 5 to 9) via an input form.
2. Designate cells:
   - *Start cell:* Selected cell turns green.
   - *End cell:* Selected cell turns red.
   - *Obstacles cell:* Selected cell turns grey.Exactly n - 2 obstacles are allowed.    
Clicking a marked cell again removes its designation.


## HW1-2: Policy Display and Value Evaluation
**Goal:**
Enhance the grid map by displaying a randomly generated action (up, down, left, or right arrow) for each cell as a policy.    
Additionally, perform policy evaluation to derive the value V(s) for each state.
